# <p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Andrew Virts.</p>
### <p align="center">Web Developer from the Bayou</p>
A curious learner and passionate creator sharing my journey with the world. Using my skills and passions to make a positive impact and empower others to do the same. 

I am driven by a passion for creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. I'm always on the lookout for new and challenging projects that allow me to continue learning and growing in this field.

I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from small business websites to large-scale web applications. I am highly collaborative and enjoy working with a team, but am also comfortable taking on individual projects and seeing them through to completion.

When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me hanging out with my family, playing video games, or watching sports.

On my GitHub profile, you'll get a glimpse into my work and the projects I've undertaken so far. I hope you find them interesting and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
