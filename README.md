# <p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Andrew Virts.</p>
### <p align="center">Integrated Web Strategist on the Bayou</p>
A curious learner and passionate creator sharing my journey with the world. Using my skills and passions to make a positive impact and empower others to do the same. 

I am driven by a passion for creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. I'm always on the lookout for new, challenging projects that allow me to continue learning and growing in this field.

I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from small business websites to large-scale web applications. I am highly collaborative and enjoy working with a team, but am also comfortable taking on individual projects and seeing them through to completion.

When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me hanging out with my family, playing video games, or watching sports.
